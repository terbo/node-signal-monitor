miscellenous stuff related to the project

You know, the other day, my main server crashed.

Something to do with a flaky USB 3 cable and a short, or a driver issue.

It had been on for 166 days last I checked.

The last time it had been power cycled, I was on the phone and accidentially
plugged the wrong one. Then it was around a month. Aand we live in an area
with seasonal blackouts, compounding the achievement.


All of that just to get to the point - this beefy 16GB machine's
main responsibility besides a dev shell, was running mongo db and sigmon..
which, after the years, was only capturing on one sensor, though placed at
a decent vantage point.

I really need to keep track of one possible bad actor. So it was running.

At the same time, sigmon.js is at the point where I have had it up for days
and it works decently on the RPI sensors.

So I've de-commisioned sigmon 0.9z.

Long live sigmon.js 0.0.5!!
