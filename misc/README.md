miscellenous stuff related to the project

You know, the other day, my main server crashed.

Something to do with a flaky USB 3 cable and a short, or a driver issue.

It had been on for 166 days last I checked.

The last time it had been power cycled, I was on the phone and accidentially
plugged the wrong one. Then it was around a month. Aand we live in an area
with seasonal blackouts, compounding the achievement.


All of that just to get to the point - this beefy 16GB machine's
main responsibility besides a dev shell, was running mongo db and sigmon..
which, after the years, was only capturing on one sensor, though placed at
a decent vantage point.

I really need to keep track of one possible bad actor. So it was running.

At the same time, sigmon.js is at the point where I have had it up for days
and it works decently on the RPI sensors.

So I've de-commisioned sigmon 0.9z.

Long live sigmon.js 0.0.5!!

coincidences aren't new in sigmon's long testing phase... as just before I
committed the first somewhat finalish version 5 years ago, someone quite
brazenly made off with my laptop and ipad...

it was my own stupidity, but then, I was also spending a lot of time
catering to the whims that inspired me to envision this project which has
tainted the last few yars of my life with a dim electromagnetic spectrum overlay.


some time before I commited that code, I had an "ah-ha" moment, watching CreepyDOL's
author explain just how verbose our beloved devices had been designed to be.. and
it was almost like, duh, yea i've used kismet since day one, ikr... but, wait, oh,
whaaat?

maybe a decade+ too late, but it has lead me to see what dragorn (and many others)
have done with the kismet project - created a community of enthusiests, professionals,
tinkers, and bleeding edge amazon addicts founded around the ideal of a personal gargoyle
device... in every home!


so thats pretty cool.
